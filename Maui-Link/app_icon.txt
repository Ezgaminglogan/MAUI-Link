ðŸ“± MAUI-Link Icon Concept
========================

Simple, modern icon design:
- Phone/device silhouette
- Link/connection lines
- Clean, minimalist style
- Dark theme compatible

Alternative icon ideas:
ðŸ”— ðŸ“± ðŸ’» ðŸ”Œ âš¡

For actual implementation, you would need:
1. .ico file for Windows
2. .png files in various sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256)
3. High-resolution versions for modern displays

The current design uses emoji icons in the UI which work well
for the modern, professional look you requested.
